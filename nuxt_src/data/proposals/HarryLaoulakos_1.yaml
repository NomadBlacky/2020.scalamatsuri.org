  title: "Algebras in Programming"
  length: 40

  keywords:

    - Algebra
    - ADT
  detail: |
    Tuples, case classes and sealed traits are common data structures in Scala. Sometimes called products and co-products, they define algebraic data types. They are called ADTs in abbreviation. But where is the algebra in them?
    The correspondence of data structures that we use every day in Scala with “regular” is not obvious at first sight.
    Also, the term algebra is used in different concepts, like free monads, tagless final interpreters and recursion schemes. After watching this talk the use of this ambiguous term will be clarified.
    No previous scala knowledge required.
